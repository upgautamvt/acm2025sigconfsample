\begin{abstract}
This paper presents BlueFort, a novel approach to organizing ACM research papers using modular LaTeX files. 
We demonstrate how separating content into individual section files improves maintainability, 
collaboration, and version control while maintaining full ACM compliance. 
Our approach reduces compilation errors and simplifies the writing process for large research teams.
